#Vector Calculus Module
This python module uses the NumPy module to perform common vector calculus operations, such as divergence and curl, on 2D scalar and vector data.

#Installation
As of yet, I have nothing fancy set up. Either copy the `vector_calculus` folder to the directory in which you want to use it, or stick it in your python path.

#Usage
The package contains examples with plots (requires matplotlib) demonstrating the use of each of the functions.
